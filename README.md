## Finding the Component

This component can be found under the **CoreAcademy** account on Community Content.

## Overview

The Bartending component allows players to pick up a pint, fill it with beet from barrels, and serve it for other players to drink.

## How to use

Drag the Bartending template into the Hierarchy. Enter preview mode and pick up a cup from the bar. Go to the barrels to fill up the up. You can now drink the pint, or place it on the bar to serve it to other players to drink.

Inside the template in the scripts folder, there is a Pint script that has custom properties on it to modify the name, amount of uses, and the template used for the cup.

This component was extracted from the LootMMO Open Source project.
